Code for Final Project - Hamza Elhamdadi, Cuong Than, Tianci Xie, Hyuk-Je Kwon

# Our Submitted agent

To load our agent use the following code

```from mcts_player import MCTSPlayer```

We have necessary pretrained files in the directory MCTS/params/

as well as additional code dependencies in the file hand_type.py

# Additional files

Our training for MCTS was done using the code in the files MCTS/MCTS_win_rate.py and MCTS/River_win_rate.py

Our analysis was done using testhyperparam.py, testperf.py, and RL_test.py

We have an additional model called RLPlayer that we describe in our report. This is not our final mdoel.
